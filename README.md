# 01 HTML, CSS, and Git: Code Refactor

## Added symantic elements to HTML and cleaned up CSS styling

I gave my best to be the junior developer I aspire to be. Code was left cleaner than when started.

Follow these instructions to see changes made to files:

1. Title was renamed.

2. Accessibility was upgraded with comments.

3. Alternatives were added to images.

4. Class rulesets were combined due to redundencies.

5. Class and element names were changed to reflect changes made to elements in HTML.

6. Changed the header size in the footer.
